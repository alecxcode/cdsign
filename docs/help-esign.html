  <h1>Digitally sign a document: how to use the app</h1>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <div>
    A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of electronic documents. With this app it uses secret and public keys, and detached digital signature file.<br>
    With secret key you can sign an electronic document, secret key should not be transferred to any other person. Public key should be given to another person in order they can verify your signature and document integrity.<br>
    When you sign a file with a digital signature a hash is being generated, which then modified by cryptographic algorithms. This modified hash is the digital signature of a specific electronic document.<br>
    All this is essential in order to verify (using public key and that hash) that a a specific electronic document signed by a person specified in that public key and not modified during transmission (integrity check).<br>
    Although, this program does not utilize any certificate authority (an entity that issues digital certificates).<br>
    This application itself does not have any cryptographic algorithms, for this purpose it utilizes another program - <a href="https://gnupg.org" target="_blank">GPG</a>. This app is basically simplified graphical user interface for GPG.<br>
    Public key and digital signature files, generated with the application you can send to another person so they can verify your signature and an electronic document integrity with <b>Check document digital signature</b> application.<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <h3>Create digital signature keys</h3>
  <div>
    In order to generate digital signature keys:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Launch the application</li>
      <li>Press the button <b>Create DS keys...</b></li>
      <li>Input the data requested</li>
      <li>Press the button <b>Generate keys</b></li>
      <li>Wait until the process of generation ends</li>
      <li>The application should display the result</li>
    </ol>
    The key you created will be shown next time you launch the app in the main window. Public and Secret keys are stored in a keyring of the GPG program.<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <h3>Export a public key to give to another person</h3>
  <div>
    To export a public key you just press <b>Export public key...</b> button and select or enter filename to save the key to.<br>
    The file will have an extension of <b>.key</b>. The application should display the result of export.<br>
    It is necessary to send this public key to other parties you interact with. They will need it to check your digital signature and integrity of electronic documents.<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <h3>Sign a file with a digital signature</h3>
  <div>
    In order to sign a file with a digital signature:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Launch the application</li>
      <li>Press the button <b>Document (or contract) file...</b></li>
      <li>Select a file to sign</li>
      <li>Press the button <b>Sign the file</b></li>
      <li>The application should display the result</li>
    </ol>
    Digital signature file generated with the app (you can find in a directory with a signed file, and it usually has an extension of <b>.asc</b>) you need to send to another party with a signed file. Using these files and a public key they can check your digital signature and integrity of electronic documents.<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <h3>Application settings (for advanced users)</h3>
  <div>
    The settings are: (1) GPG executable name; (2) last generated key ID.<br>
    The settings are stored in: <b>user_home_directory/.edm/cdsign-esign.ini</b><br>
  </div>
